Multipotentialite  
endoplasmic uncertainty / if converted to audio -- random static 
Germ cells, stem cells, follow their sacred path
all the while sputtering, grabbing and gulping unknown intermediaries
indiscriminate yet discrete they swiftly convert molecules, 
as the author rearranges letters, words, whole thoughts
leaving behind void / being, born in space, held by time
these unlikely pinpricks of hope / joyously exist!
holy instances of the unimaginable creative force that hides everywhere,
within everywhen.
Just so these words iterate again the hosanna of the universe,
unique in spacetime yet the same 
holy, holy, holy is the space between the spaces
